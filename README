Requirements
------------
  + POSIX.1b-compliant operating system (librt)
  + GNU GCC 4.6 or newer
  + GNU Make
  + Python 2.7 or newer (only for style checking)


Dependencies
------------
  + lpsolve55 (not included)
  + gflags (included)
  + gtest (included, only required for testing)
  + cpplint (included, only required for style checking)
  + gperftools (not included, only required for profiling)


Building gflags
---------------
  Before building Ash, you need to build gflags locally once:
  $ make gflags

  Alternatively you can build all dependencies at once:
  $ make depend


Building Ash (depends on gflags)
--------------------------------
  To build Ash use:
  $ make

  For performance measuring use the more optimised version:
  $ make opt


Running Ash performance tests
-----------------------------
  To run performance tests on some benchmark problems use:
  $ make perftest

  All test parameters can be changed on invocation like this:
  $ make perftest LOG=log/perftest.txt


Building gtest
--------------
  Before building the tests, you need to build gtest locally once:
  $ make gtest


Testing Ash (depends on gtest)
------------------------------
  To build and run the unit tests use:
  $ make test


Profiling Ash (depends on gperftools)
--------------------------------------
  To build Ash with profiling turned on use:
  $ make profile


Checking style
--------------
  To test code style conformance with the Google C++ Style Guide
  (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) use:
  $ make checkstyle


Using Ash
---------
  $ ash game.nfg

  To show the full usage and flags help use:
  $ ash -help
